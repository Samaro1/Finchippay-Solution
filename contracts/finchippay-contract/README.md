# finchippay-contract

Soroban smart contract for the **Finchippay-Solution** platform on Stellar.

## Streaming Payments

A stream releases tokens continuously per ledger. At ledger `L`:

```
elapsed   = L - start_ledger
streamed  = rate_per_ledger × elapsed   (capped at deposited)
claimable = min(streamed, deposited) - claimed
```

Recipients can call `claim_stream` at any time to drain accrued tokens. Payers can `top_up_stream` to extend the stream or `close_stream` to end it early (accrued tokens go to the recipient; remainder is refunded).

## Multi-Sig Payments

`create_multisig` locks funds and stores a list of allowed `signers` plus a `threshold` N. Each call to `approve_multisig` by a distinct signer appends to the approval list. When `approvals.len() >= threshold` the payment executes automatically in the same transaction — no separate execution call required.

## Security

- Every mutating entry-point calls `require_auth()` on the authorising address.
- All arithmetic uses `checked_add` / `checked_sub` / `checked_mul`; overflows panic rather than silently wrap.
- Storage TTLs are bumped on every read and write to prevent ledger expiry.
- `EscrowStatus`, `MultiSigStatus`, and `closed` fields prevent double-claim and double-cancel attacks.
- **Reentrancy guard**: every value-transferring entry point acquires a non-reentrancy lock (a transient flag in instance storage) and follows checks-effects-interactions ordering, so a hostile token contract cannot double-claim, double-drain, or double-swap funds by calling back into the contract from inside `token.transfer`. Nested calls abort with `ContractError::ReentrantCall`.
- **RBAC**: A separate `pauser` role can freeze/unfreeze operations without admin upgrade rights via `set_pauser`.
- **Upgradability**: admin can call `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` to deploy security patches without migrating state. Version is tracked and incremented on each upgrade.
- **Bounded inputs**:
  - Escrow release ledgers are capped at `MAX_ESCROW_LEDGERS` (~30 days).
  - Stream deposits are capped at `MAX_STREAM_DEPOSIT` with cumulative top-up enforcement.
  - Stream rates are capped at `MAX_STREAM_RATE` to prevent overflow.
  - Multi-sig proposals are capped at `MAX_MULTISIG_AMOUNT` and `MAX_MULTISIG_SIGNERS` (20).
- Escrow amounts are capped at `MAX_ESCROW_AMOUNT` and have a minimum of `MIN_ESCROW_AMOUNT` to prevent dust attacks.
- Multi-sig proposals have a minimum of `MIN_MULTISIG_AMOUNT` and can include an `expiration_ledger` to auto-expire abandoned proposals.
- Multi-sig signer lists are checked for duplicates at creation time.
- Self-transfers (from == to) are rejected for tips, escrows, streams, and multi-sig.
- Batch sends are limited to `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (50) recipients and amounts are pre-validated for atomicity.
- All operational entry points require the contract to be initialized via `initialize()`.
- **Balance reconciliation**: the contract keeps a cached `LastContractBalance`
  per token to avoid re-reading `token.balance(contract)` on every deposit.
  For standard assets the cache matches reality; if it ever drifts (rebasing
  or fee-on-transfer tokens, or direct transfers to the contract address) the
  drift is surfaced on read via a `balance_drift_detected` event and the cache
  self-heals, and an admin-gated `reconcile_balance` action resyncs it
  explicitly (see "Supported Token Model").

## Supported Token Model

**Standard, non-rebasing Stellar assets** (SAC-issued fungible tokens whose
`transfer` moves the full `amount` and whose balances only change through
transfers) are fully supported: the cached `LastContractBalance` matches the
real on-chain balance, and every deposit/claim settles exactly.

**Fee-on-transfer / taxed / deflationary tokens** (where `transfer` moves
*less* than `amount` into the recipient) are supported by the measured contract
swap entry points and remain rejected by other deposit-style flows:
the phantom-deposit check in `require_transfer_succeeded` compares the actual
balance deltas and rejects the operation (`TransferFailed`) rather than locking
a balance that never fully arrived. This is deliberate — it guarantees **no
funds can be over-claimed** when such a token is used.

**Rebasing tokens** (whose balance changes without a transfer) are **not**
supported without explicit reconciliation. A rebase drifts the cached balance
from `token.balance(contract)`; the drift is detected and surfaced on the next
read (`balance_drift_detected` event) and the cache self-heals, or an admin can
force a resync via the `reconcile_balance` admin action (`balance_reconciled`
event).

### Reconcile flow

`reconcile_balance` is an admin-gated action executed through the admin signer
multi-sig (`propose_admin_action` with `action_type = "reconcile_balance"` and
`action_data = [token_address]`). It reads the actual `token.balance(contract)`,
resyncs `LastContractBalance`, and emits `balance_reconciled` with the
`(old, new)` values. It performs **no token transfers** — it only reads a
balance and updates a cached value — so a drifted cache can never be used to
extract funds.

## Contract Event Migration

This contract currently uses the legacy `publish()` API for emitting contract
events. The Soroban SDK has deprecated `publish()` in favor of the
`#[contractevent]` attribute macro.

### Migration Steps

1. Replace all `env.events().publish(...)` calls with `#[contractevent]`
   struct definitions and `env.events().publish(&event)` invocations.
2. Bump `STORAGE_LAYOUT_VERSION` and ensure the new event types are documented.
3. Update the event indexer (`backend/src/services/eventIndexer.js`) to parse
   the new topic format (the `#[contractevent]` macro generates a 16-byte topic
   hash from the struct name).
4. Re-deploy and verify with `soroban contract invoke --id <C> -- events`.

### Tracking

- Issue: `#amm-integration` (yield_escrow.rs TODOs)
- Contract version in Cargo.toml and on-chain `get_version()` must stay in sync.
