# Error codes

> **Last generated:** 2026-08-18 04:34:48 UTC

Every error Finchippay returns carries a machine-readable code from a single
catalogue shared by the contract, the API, and the frontend. This document is
generated from that catalogue, so it cannot drift from the code.

**88 codes** are defined in [`shared/errorCodes.js`](../shared/errorCodes.js).

## Response format

Every API error uses the same body:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VAL_INVALID_PUBLIC_KEY",
    "message": "Invalid Stellar public key format.",
    "correlationId": "6f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8192-a3b4c5d6e7f8",
    "details": { "field": "destination" }
  }
}
```

| Field | Always present | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `error.code` | yes | Machine-readable code from this catalogue. Switch on this, never on the message. |
| `error.message` | yes | Human-readable description. Written for developers; the frontend maps codes to user-facing copy separately. |
| `error.correlationId` | on API responses | Matches the `X-Request-ID` response header and the `correlationId` field in the server logs. |
| `error.details` | no | Code-specific context: the offending field, the received value, and so on. |

The `error` key is at the top level, so consumers written against the original
`{ error }` contract keep working.

### Correlation IDs

The API generates a UUID for every request, or adopts an inbound
`X-Request-ID` header if the caller supplies one. That value is:

1. returned in the `X-Request-ID` response header,
2. embedded as `error.correlationId` in error bodies,
3. logged with every log line for the request.

Quoting one ID therefore locates the failure across all three. See
[`backend/src/utils/correlationId.js`](../backend/src/utils/correlationId.js).

## Naming

Codes are `CATEGORY_SPECIFIC`. The category prefix determines the owning
layer, so the layer never has to be repeated in the code itself — use
`getErrorLayer(code)` to resolve it programmatically.

**Message template placeholders:** Some messages contain placeholders that are
replaced at runtime with context-specific values:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<token>` | An authentication token value |
| `<destination>` | A Stellar address or account ID |
| `<amount>` | A numeric amount in stroops or lumen |
| `<field>` | A request body field name |
| `<limit>` | A maximum allowed value (rate, size, count) |

## Category overview

| Prefix | Layer | Codes | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_*` | api | 6 | Authentication and authorization |
| `CONTRACT_*` | contract | 29 | Soroban contract |
| `GEN_*` | shared | 3 | Generic |
| `PAY_*` | api | 9 | Payments and transactions |
| `RATE_*` | api | 3 | Rate limiting |
| `RES_*` | api | 7 | Resource lifecycle |
| `SRV_*` | api | 6 | Server and infrastructure |
| `TOKEN_*` | api | 1 | Legacy aliases |
| `VAL_*` | api | 17 | Request validation |
| `WALLET_*` | frontend | 7 | Browser wallet |

    "correlationId": "6f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8192-a3b4c5d6e7f8"
  }
}
```

    "correlationId": "6f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8192-a3b4c5d6e7f8"
  }
}
```

    "correlationId": "6f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8192-a3b4c5d6e7f8"
  }
}

    "code": "RATE_LIMITED_GLOBAL",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
    "correlationId": "6f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8192-a3b4c5d6e7f8"
  }

    "code": "PAY_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE",
    "message": "Insufficient balance for this transaction.",
    "correlationId": "6f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8192-a3b4c5d6e7f8"
  }
}
```

## Using the catalogue

### Backend

Prefer [`backend/src/utils/errorResponse.js`](../backend/src/utils/errorResponse.js),
which resolves the HTTP status from the catalogue so a status can never drift
from its code:

```js
const { sendError, createError } = require("../utils/errorResponse");

// Respond immediately.
return sendError(res, "VAL_INVALID_PUBLIC_KEY", {
  details: { field: "destination" },
});

// Or hand off to the global error handler.
return next(createError("RES_NOT_FOUND"));
```

### Frontend

[`frontend/lib/handleError.ts`](../frontend/lib/handleError.ts) maps a code to
user-facing copy and a recovery action:

```ts
const handled = await handleApiError(response);
// handled.title        -> "Not enough balance"
// handled.userMessage  -> "Your balance will not cover this payment ..."
// handled.action       -> { kind: "fund", label: "Add funds" }
// handled.correlationId -> "6f1a2b3c-..."
```

Recovery actions are `retry`, `reconnect`, `reauth`, `fix_input`,
`wait`, `fund`, `contact_support`, and `none`.

### Contract

The Soroban contract's `ContractError` enum returns numeric variants. The
`ContractError` column below gives the variant each `CONTRACT_*` code maps
from; `getContractErrorCode(n)` performs the lookup.
